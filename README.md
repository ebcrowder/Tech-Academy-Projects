# Tech-Academy-Projects
These are my Tech Academy projects for learning purposes.

These projects showcase the tools and functionality that I learned 
from utilizing C#, Microsoft SQL Server, ASP.NET Core 2.0 MVC, HTML, CSS, 
JavaScript and the Bootstrap framework in projects assigned by the 
instructors at the Tech Academy.
